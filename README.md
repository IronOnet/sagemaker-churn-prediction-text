# Churn Prediction With Text

TBD

## Getting Started

To get started quickly, use the following quick-launch link to launch a CloudFormation Stack create form and follow the instructions below to deploy the resources in this project.

| Region | Stack |
| ---- | ---- |
|US East (N. Virginia) | [<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png">](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://sagemaker-solutions-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/Churn-prediction-with-text/cloudformation/template.yaml&stackName=sagemaker-soln-churn) |
|US East (Ohio) | [<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png">](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://sagemaker-solutions-us-east-2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Churn-prediction-with-text/cloudformation/template.yaml&stackName=sagemaker-soln-churn) |
|US West (Oregon) | [<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png">](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://sagemaker-solutions-us-west-2.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Churn-prediction-with-text/cloudformation/template.yaml&stackName=sagemaker-soln-churn) |


### Additional Instructions

* On the stack creation page, check the box to acknowledge creation of IAM resources, and click **Create Stack**. This should trigger the creation of the CloudFormation stack.

* Once the stack is created, go to the Outputs tab and click on the *SageMakerNotebook* link. This will open up a Jupyter notebook named `churn_prediction` in a SageMaker Notebook instance where you can run the code. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the solution. You can use `Cells->Run All` from the Jupyter menu to run all cells, and return to the notebook later after all cells have executed. The total time to run all cells should be around 40 minutes.
